IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL CREATE A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK WHICH WILL BE ABLE TO PREDICT WHETHER A PLANT IS SUFFERING FROM A DISEASE. WE WILL USE DIFFERENT LAYERS AND OTHER HYPERPARAMETERS FOR BUILDING, TRAINING, AND TESTING THIS CLASSIFICATION MODEL. WE WILL BE USING TENSORFLOW AND KERAS FOR THIS PROJECT.</h3>

  <h2>The Steps to solve the problem </h2>

<h3>
1. MOUNTING GOOGLE DRIVE ON COLLAB NOTEBOOK <br>
2. VISUALIZING THE IMAGES THAT WE WILL BE WORKING ON <br>
3.FINDING OUT THE MEAN OF THE DIMENSIONS AND RESIZING ALL IMAGES ACCORDINGLY. <br>
4. CONVERTING THE IMAGES INTO A NUMPY ARRAY AND NORMALIZE THEM. <br>
5. CHECKING CLASS IMBALANCE. <br>
6. SPLITTING THE DATA AND PERFORMING ONE-HOT ENCODING. <br>
7. CREATING THE MODEL ARCHITECTURE, COMPILING THE MODEL AND THEN FITTING IT. <br>
8.PLOTTING THE ACCURACY AND LOSS AGAINST EACH EPOCH. <br>
9. PREPROCESSING THE TEST DATA AND MAKE PREDICTIONS ON IT. <br>
10. VISUALIZING THE ORIGINAL AND PREDICTED LABELS FOR THE TEST IMAGES. <br>
